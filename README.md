# bot
Pacman Softworks unblacklister bot, archived because I quit condos and also because this is pretty much patched (I don't know for sure)

# how do i use this?
figure out yourself. what you're really gonna want is unblacklister.py though.

# yeah but how do i use unblacklister.py?
ight so. put unblacklister.py in a folder with a .rbxlx file\
- windows instructions:\
type this into ur command line\
```bat
py unblacklister.py <UR FILE NAME LIKE lol.rbxlx> true
```\
boom! unblacklisted!
